                <p>Five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek has been handed a one-month suspension after testing positive for trimetazidine (TMZ), a prohibited substance typically used as a heart medication. The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced that the violation was unintentional and likely caused by contamination in a melatonin supplement Swiatek used for jet lag.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The ITIA concluded that Swiatek bore minimal fault, placing her case at the "lowest end of the range for no significant fault or negligence." Swiatek formally admitted to the anti-doping violation and agreed to the suspension. She had already served 12 days of a provisional ban in late September, missing the Korea Open, China Open, and Wuhan Open. With eight days of her suspension remaining, she will now serve the remainder during the off-season, clearing her to return on December 4.

                    <br>
                    Swiatek, a 23-year-old from Poland and a former world No. 1, had a stellar year, including winning her fifth Grand Slam at the French Open and earning a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics. She also reached the semifinals of the Cincinnati Open in August but was stripped of $158,944 in prize money following the positive test.

                    <br>
                    ITIA CEO Karen Moorhouse emphasized the strict liability of the World Anti-Doping Code, reminding athletes to be vigilant with medications and supplements. While melatonin is regulated as a medicine in Poland, it doesn’t carry the same classification worldwide, which contributed to Swiatek’s inadvertent exposure to TMZ.

                    <br>
                    Swiatek's case follows another high-profile doping incident involving men’s world No. 1 Jannik Sinner, who was cleared of steroid allegations earlier this year. Both cases highlight the ongoing challenges of supplement contamination in professional tennis.
